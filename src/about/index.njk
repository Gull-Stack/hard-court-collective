        <h2>The Problem We Set Out to Solve</h2>
        <p>Hard Court Collective was born from a simple observation: the best court builders weren't always getting the best projects. Skilled contractors with decades of experience were losing $200K+ jobs to competitors who simply had better websites and marketing.</p>
        
        <p>We saw facility owners, school districts, and property managers searching Google for "[sport] court contractor [city]" and finding flashy websites from contractors with inferior work quality. Meanwhile, the craftsmen who built championship-quality surfaces remained invisible online.</p>
        
        <p>The sports surface industry deserved better. These contractors needed marketing that matched the caliber of their craftsmanship.</p>
        
        <p>Today, Hard Court Collective combines deep industry knowledge with cutting-edge marketing technology to help sports surface professionals compete on expertise, not just price.</p>

          <p class="text-large"><em>"To elevate the entire sports surface industry by ensuring the most skilled contractors get the recognition and projects they deserve through professional marketing that reflects their expertise."</em></p>

      <h2>Core Values That Drive Everything We Do</h2>

    <div class="grid grid-3">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Quality Over Quantity</h3>
        <p>We'd rather work with 50 contractors who build exceptional courts than 500 who compete on price alone. Quality craftsmanship deserves quality marketing.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Performance-Focused</h3>
        <p>Every strategy, campaign, and piece of content is measured by one metric: does it generate qualified leads for quality projects? If it doesn't drive revenue, we don't do it.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Community-Driven</h3>
        <p>We're building a collective of the industry's best contractors. When one succeeds, we all succeed. Competition is with inferior contractors, not each other.</p>
